These codes are provided: 
1) to update develop.20050606.tar.gz with the most recent LOBPCG version, or 
2) as a reference only, since after July 2005 Hypre already has 
all these files incorporated. 

To update develop.20050606.tar.gz, run 

./before_make.sh Hypre_Home

where Hypre_Home is the develop.20050606.tar.gz install directory. 
Then, configure and make Hypre in the usual way. 
If you run later 
make distclean
you need to re-run 
./before_make.sh Hypre_Home
